# Archive Directory

This directory contains files that are preserved for reference but should not be included in the main codebase distribution.

## Purpose

Files in this directory are:
- Historical or experimental code that may be useful for future reference
- Large datasets or models that are too big for the main repository
- Internal documentation not intended for public release
- Configuration files with sensitive information (sanitized)

## Contents

- `prepare_report.md` - 项目提交准备报告，记录了 v2.0.0 发布前的完整结构优化和清理过程
- `report.md` - 项目审查报告，记录了代码质量、安全性和结构优化的详细分析
- *(其他文件将在项目清理过程中根据需要添加到此目录)*

## Access

Files in this directory are not part of the normal project structure and should not be referenced by the main application code.
